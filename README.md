The Mac@IBM enrollment app makes setting up macOS with Jamf Pro more intuitive for users and easier for IT. The application offers IT admins the ability to gather additional information about their users during setup, allows users to customize their enrollment by selecting apps or bundles of apps to install during setup, and provides users with next steps when enrollment is complete.
